# Matrix Group Front-End Developer Challenge

This is the Front-End Developer Challenge for the Matrix Group. The server uses Express to serve an `index.html` file that contains the website design.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your system.

### Installing

Follow these steps to get your development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/patrisor/MatrixGroupDeveloperChallenge.git]
   cd MatrixGroupDeveloperChallenge
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   From the project directory, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Express**

   If Express is not already included in your project's dependencies, install it by running:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

   This command will add Express to your project's node_modules folder and update the package.json file.

4. **Start the server**

   Run the server with:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The server should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

After starting the server, you can access the `index.html` page by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
